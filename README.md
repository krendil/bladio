# Bladio - Blaseball Radio

## Description

Bladio simulates a radio-style broadcast of a Blaseball game based on the stream of game events.
Features include:

- Commentary generated by [Mimic 3 TTS](https://mycroft.ai/mimic-3/)
- Realistic *thwack*ing noises

Coming soon:

- Crowd noises
- Live streaming directly from the source

## How to use

To generate a broadcast for a game, you need a json dump of the games events from Chronicler.
Then, pass in the filename of the json dump with the `-f` flag. Bladio will output ogg vorbis data
to stdout. Example:

```
curl https://api2.sibr.dev/chronicler/v0/game-events?game_id=2376b471-2aba-49fb-957d-18a6897ebb74 > game_log.json
cargo run -- -f game_log.json > output.ogg
```

Then listen to `output.ogg` with your favourite music player. You should be able to start listening
while bladio is still running.

## Requirements

I recommend that you use the devcontainer for ease of setup. If you don't want to, you'll need the following:

- A recent version of rustc/cargo
- libpython >= 3.8 (including header files)
- mycroft-mimic3-tts (from pip)
- maturin (also from pip)
